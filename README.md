## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
This project wsa my first rodeo with CSS Grid. It was a new way of thinking that I was not used to. What helped me tremendously in this project was the ```grid-areas``` feature. Helped me keep my CSS shorter and more readable.

### Continued development
I would like to keep working on more CSS Grid projects by building more complex layouts till I understand all the concepts inside and out.

### Useful resources

- [Wes Bos CSS Grid](https://cssgrid.io/) - This is where I learned the concepts of CSS Grid.
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - Amazing resource anytime you need a reference while making grids.

## Acknowledgments
I would like to thank [Darkstar](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/DarkstarXDD/solutions) from the wonderful front-end mentor community for helping me with this project. He taught me a neat little trick on how I can create a custom border using the ```::before``` pseudo-element.
